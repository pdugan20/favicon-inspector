Inspect what Google's favicon services serve and cache for a set of domains, and flag the icons that come back wrong.

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

Requires Node 22 (`nvm use`).

## Usage

```bash
npm start                                       # capture snapshot -> reports/
npm start -- --compare reports/<older>.json     # capture fresh, diff vs older
npm start -- --compare <a>.json <b>.json        # diff two snapshots offline
```

`npm start` writes a timestamped HTML report and JSON sibling to `reports/`, grading each icon `OK` / `WARN` / `ALERT`. Compare mode diffs two snapshots and reports only the cells that changed.

## Configuration

Edit `src/config.ts` to change the domain list, sizes, or per-domain `expected: 'transparent' | 'opaque'` (suppresses black-background alerts for domains whose icon is legitimately an opaque tile).
